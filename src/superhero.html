    <p>A <strong>superhero</strong><sup>[1]</sup> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character
        who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and
        usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine
        or super heroine), although the word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre
        of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.</p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/BlackHood.jpg" alt="hero" width="300">
    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary
        gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful
        or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes
        used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless
        share similar traits.</p>
    <p>Some superheroes use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
        who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
        Some long-running superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the
        Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>

    <h3 id="earlyhistory">Early history</h3>
    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
        who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
        of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp
        fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
        appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]</p>
    <p>In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10]
        (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13]
        (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>
    <h3>1940s</h3>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient
        Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil;
        she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".[14][15]
        The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower
        of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months
        later on June 3, 1940.[16]</p>
    <p>One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary
        of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely
        Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this era
        lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,[17][18] introduced in Standard Comics' Thrilling
        Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit Section June 2,
        1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,[19] debuting
        in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced in Quality
        Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced in Harvey Comics' Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug.
        1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character.[22] The most iconic
        comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman.[23] Modeled from the myth of the Amazons
        of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife
        Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.[24][25] Wonder Woman's first appearance was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec.
        1941), published by All-American Publications, one of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.</p>
    <h3>1950s</h3>
    <p>In 1952, Osamu Tezuka's manga Tetsuwan Atom (more popularly known in the west as Astro Boy) was published. The series
        focused upon a robot boy built by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally
        intended for military purposes Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and
        the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs.</p>
    <p>The 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl, Miss
        Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male superheroes. 1958 saw the debut of superhero
        Moonlight Mask on Japanese television.</p>
    <h3>1960s</h3>
    <p>The Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s typically included at least one (and often the only) female member, much like
        DC's flagship superhero team the Justice League of America (whose initial roster included Wonder Woman as the token
        female); examples include the Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, the X-Men's Jean Grey (originally known as Marvel
        Girl), the Avengers' Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants' Scarlet Witch (who later joined the Avengers). In 1963,
        Astro Boy was adapted into a highly influential anime television series. Phantom Agents in 1964 focused on ninjas
        working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type series. 1966 saw the debut of sci-fi/horror
        series Ultra Q created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead on to the sequel Ultraman, spawning a successful
        franchise focused upon the Giant Hero subgenre where the Superheroes would be as big as giant monsters (Kaiju) that
        they fought.</p>
    <h3>1970s</h3>
    <p>In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action
        Phantom Agents as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said
        vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by Go Nagai, creating
        the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in 1973, although the Magical Girl genre already
        existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media.</p>
    <p>The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori's
        Skull Man in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John Romita's Punisher in 1974.</p>
    <p>The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes. The protagonist was redesigned
        resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen Rider series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle
        riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Transform) to don his costume and gain superhuman powers.</p>
    <p>The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic book
        companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing
        martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television series The Avengers (no relation
        to the superhero team of the same name),[26] but later reverted to Marston's original concept after the editors of
        Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional costume;[27] Supergirl
        was moved from being a secondary feature on Action Comics to headline Adventure Comics in 1969; the Lady Liberators
        appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group of mind-controlled superheroines led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised
        supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists;[28] and Jean Grey became the embodiment
        of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast from
        her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Both major publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin
        stories or character development. Examples include Big Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from
        Marvel, the second Black Widow, Shanna the She-Devil, and The Cat.[29] Female supporting characters who were successful
        professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero
        titles from the late 1950s onward: Hal Jordan's love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of
        Ferris Aircraft and later took over the company from her father; Medusa, who was first introduced in the Fantastic
        Four series, is a member of the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal
        society; and Carol Danvers, a decorated officer in the United States Air Force who would become a costumed superhero
        herself years later.</p>
    <p>In 1975 Shotaro Ishinomori's Himitsu Sentai Gorenger debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored
        teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action. In 1978, Toei adapted Spider-Man into a
        live-action series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant
        and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's Battle Fever J and now multi-colored
        teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with.</p>
    <h3>1980s onwards</h3>
    <p>In subsequent decades, popular characters like Dazzler, She-Hulk, Elektra, Catwoman, Witchblade, Spider-Girl, Batgirl
        and the Birds of Prey became stars of long-running eponymous titles. Female characters began assuming leadership
        roles in many ensemble superhero teams; the Uncanny X-Men series and its related spin-off titles in particular have
        included many female characters in pivotal roles since the 1970s.[30] Volume 4 of the X-Men comic book series featured
        an all-female team as part of the Marvel NOW! branding initiative in 2013.[31] Superpowered female characters like
        Buffy the Vampire Slayer[32] and Darna[33][34] have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective
        countries of origin.</p>
    <p>With more and more anime, manga and Tokusatsu being translated or adapted, western audiences were beginning to experience
        the Japanese styles of superhero fiction more than they were able to before. Saban's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,
        an adaptation of Zyuranger created a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai.[35] Internationally,
        the Japanese comic book character, Sailor Moon, is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes
        ever created.[36][37][38][39][40]</p>
    <h3>Common traits</h3>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
            senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom
            and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques,
            and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology,
            such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow
            and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g.
            Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
            adamantium claws).</li>
        <li> strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation of
            reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
        <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman),
            a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
            service (e.g. Superman).</li>
        <li>A secret identity that protects the superhero's friends and family from becoming targets of his or her enemies, such
            as Clark Kent (Superman), or to protect themselves from getting arrested by the police, like Spider-Man, although
            many superheroes have a confidant (usually a friend or relative who has been sworn to secrecy). Most superheroes
            use a descriptive or metaphoric code name for their public deeds. However, there are also rare ones whose true
            identities are common public knowledge, even with a costumed identity (e.g. Iron Man and Captain America).</li>
        <li>A distinctive costume, often used to conceal the secret identity (see Common costume features).</li>
    </ul>
